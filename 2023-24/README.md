You can see my version of the A* set covering algorithm in the HMTL file 'my-set-covering.ipynb'.

The cost function just counts the number of taken sets.

The 'h3' heuristic function estimates the potential contribution of each unselected set to covering the remaining uncovered elements in the problem. It does so by calculating the number of uncovered elements that each unselected set could potentially cover.

1) First, it initializes a boolean array uncovered of the same size as the problem with all elements set to False. This array keeps track of which elements are still uncovered.

2) It iterates through the sets in the taken state and updates the uncovered array using bitwise OR operations to combine it with the elements in those sets. This step helps identify the currently uncovered elements. (This way allows me to save RAM as my program crashed multiple times before. You will also notice that I reduced parameters like NUM_SETS for the same reason.)

3) Next, it searches through the unselected sets. For each unselected set, it calculates how many additional elements it could potentially cover. This is done by performing a bitwise AND operation between the unselected set and the complement of the uncovered array. The result is a count of how many elements in the unselected set could contribute to covering the remaining uncovered elements.

4) The heuristic keeps track of which unselected set could potentially cover the maximum number of uncovered elements and selects that set as the best candidate to be added to the taken state.

5) Finally, the heuristic returns the count of the maximum number of additional elements that the best unselected set could potentially cover. This value provides an estimate of the potential benefit of adding the best set to the taken state, with the goal of prioritizing sets that cover the most uncovered elements.

The h3 heuristic aims to efficiently guide the search by selecting sets that have the potential to cover a large number of remaining uncovered elements, helping to drive the algorithm towards a solution more effectively.
